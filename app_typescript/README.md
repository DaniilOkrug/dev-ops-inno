# Typescript Web Application Development

Author: Daniil Okrug

## Overview

The application displays USD exchange rates. In this project I used NextJS because it has built-in support for SSR/SSG, Typescript and follows modern standards for building web application architecture

## Structure

The /src folder contains the source code of the project in the Typescript language.

External files include NextJS configurations, linters, etc.

The /public folder contains the original HTML page and files necessary for successful rendering of the application in the browser

## Testing

You can run the application with npm run dev to test it. You should install dependencies with the npm ci command before running the application.
