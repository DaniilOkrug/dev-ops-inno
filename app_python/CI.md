# CI Best Practices in the Project - Daniil Okrug

- Parallelism: The workflow now includes a matrix strategy, allowing the same workflow to run for multiple Python versions in parallel. This can help you catch issues across different Python versions more efficiently.
- Caching Dependencies: The pip cache is now being cached to speed up dependency installation.
- Job Dependencies: The docker job now depends on the build job, ensuring that it runs only after the build job completes successfully.
- Job Isolation: Each job runs on a clean environment, providing isolation and ensuring that one job's changes don't affect another job's environment.
- Secrets: Docker Hub credentials are securely stored as GitHub secrets and accessed using secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME and secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD.
- Improved Naming and Organization: Jobs are now named appropriately to reflect their purpose and are organized in a way that makes it clear which jobs depend on others.
- Snyk: It's checking vulnerabilities now
