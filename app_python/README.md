# Python Web Application Development - Daniil Okrug

The application displays Moscow time. In this project I used Flask framework because of its convenience and simplicity in web application development.

The main file app.py contains the key path code '/', which renders the index.html page and gives the Moscow time.

The project has a teamplates folder that contains HTML pages to render to the client.

For testing and determining the percentage of test coverage pytest and pytest-cov are used. All tests are now in the tests folder.
